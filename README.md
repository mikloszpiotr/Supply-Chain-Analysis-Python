üì¶ Supply Chain Analysis with Python

Welcome to my repository showcasing various supply chain analysis techniques implemented in Python. This collection includes exploratory data analysis, clustering, regression, time series forecasting, and anomaly detection, all tailored to supply chain scenarios.

üîç Project Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions and relationships.

Clustering: Segmenting data using algorithms like K-Means.

Regression Analysis: Predicting outcomes using models such as Linear Regression, PyCaret, and PyTorch.

Time Series Forecasting: Forecasting demand using tools like Prophet, Darts, and SKTime.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers with libraries like PyOD and ADTK.

üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used
Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, pygal

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, pycaret, pytorch

Time Series Analysis: prophet, darts, sktime, adtk, pyod

üìà Notable Analyses
Clustering: Grouping similar supply chain entities to identify patterns.

Regression: Predicting key performance indicators like delivery times.

Time Series Forecasting: Anticipating future demand and inventory needs.

Anomaly Detection: Spotting irregularities in supply chain operations.
